        <h3>Coding Projects</h3>
        <p>Here are some coursework and external coding projects I have completed</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Leet Code Game (Coming Soon!)</h4>
        <p>This will allow students to have fun coding and learning while playing an interactive game that involves puzzles and objectives to escape a maze!</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Wardrobe Wise, a Digital Closet Solution</h4>
        <p>My capstone project was to create an application where users could focus on their sustainability and inventory through a "cost-per-wear" calculation. A demo video can be provided below, and the project code can be found on my git.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>This Website!</h4>
        <p>This website is built using HTML, Javascript, and CSS to showcase my experiences and projects.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>SQL Interpreter</h4>
        <p>This projects implements a simplified SQL interpreter that supports basic SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, deleting rows, and printing data with basic where clause functionality.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Traveling Salesperson</h4>
        <p>This project involved creating algorithms that solved how to get the fastest (algorithmically), most optimally given a map of locations, or the minimum spanning tree for the points on a given map.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Fakebook Database</h4>
        <p>This project involved designing a relational database to store information for the fictional social media platform Fakebook, including implementing partition and probe functions to simulate a grace hash join. A follow-up project involved executing SQL queries against a relational database to simulate standard SQL query practices in addition to hands-on experience with real-world database application programming. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Hunter vs Zombies!</h4>
        <p>This projects simulates a zombies vs hunter scenario where every round zombies moves towards a hunter and the hunter must strategically attempt to defeat them. This means that I create both zombie scenarios as well as control the hunter through a decision-making algorithm. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Solving Mazes</h4>
        <p>Given dimentions of a maze, the start and end points, as well as walls or floors/elevators, this project solves how to get from the given starting point to the end point. This is implemented utilizing both Depth First Search and Breath First Search using the queue and stack data structures.</p>

        <h4>Virtual Reality Menu</h4>
        <p>As part of the Michigan Faculty Engineering Arts Student Team, I had the opportunity to work with point clouds in virtual reality. As part of the research launch, I created a custom VR Menu to navigate the architectural point clound environments for college students.</p>
